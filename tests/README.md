## READ THIS
These tests were written during development as a practical way of answering the question: "hey, does this service *actually work*?".

In that sense, these tests currently break the point of a unit test by not only testing the services, but also the APIs - which this code has no control over.

You can track refactoring of these tests here: https://github.com/bcanseco/common-bot-library/issues/9.
