# Common Bot Library API Docs
> CBL is an asynchronous .NET library of API wrappers designed to help with typical bot commands. Things like weather, definitions, movie information, etc. are all readily available for your projects.  
**More info is available in the [Github README](https://github.com/bcanseco/common-bot-library/blob/dev/README.md)**.
